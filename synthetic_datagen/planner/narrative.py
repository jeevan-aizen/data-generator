Your task:
Generate ONLY the narrative fields listed below for this conversation plan.
Do NOT alter the tool chain, step indices, dependencies, tool IDs, or endpoint IDs.

Conversation style MUST be one of:
{list(VALID_CONVERSATION_STYLES)}

Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact structure:
{{
  "domain": "...",
  "user_goal": "...",
  "conversation_style": "...",
  "style_notes": "...",
  "steps": [
    {{

Rules:
- domain: a realistic real-world domain (e.g. "travel planning", "e-commerce", "healthcare scheduling")
- user_goal: one clear sentence describing what the user wants to accomplish
- conversation_style: exactly one value from the enum above
- style_notes: one sentence describing how the user communicates in this scenario
- For each step: purpose describes what the step achieves; user_intent is what the user wants at that moment; assistant_intent is what the assistant will do; expected_output_usage explains how the output feeds into later steps (null if last step or unused)
- Mark may_require_clarification=true only for steps in the clarification candidates list, or where you identify genuine ambiguity
- Be diverse: avoid near-duplicates of prior corpus conversations shown above

class AnthropicNarrativeBackend:
    """
    Claude-backed narrative backend for PlannerAgent.

    Implements .complete(prompt: str) -> str using the Anthropic Messages API.
    The planner's build_narrative_prompt() already produces a prompt that asks
    for a JSON response matching the expected NarrativeOutput schema — this
    backend simply executes that prompt and returns the raw text for
    parse_narrative_response() to handle.

    API key resolution order:
      1. Constructor api_key argument
      2. ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable
      3. .env file in project root

    Falls back to DeterministicNarrativeBackend if the Anthropic package is
    not installed or if no API key is found, so the pipeline never hard-fails
    at init time.
